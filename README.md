# Creating a Python Virtual Environment with Ansible

## Directory Setup

First, ensure your directory structure on the control node (where you're running Ansible) and on the target nodes (where tasks are executed) is set up correctly.

You might have:
    
Control Node:
- playbook.yml (your Ansible playbook)
- requirements.txt (list of Python packages to install)

Target Node:
- /opt/venv/ (directory for the Python virtual environment)
- /opt/scripts/ (directory for storing your Python script)

## Necessary Packages

Python Packages:

- ruamel.yaml: To parse and update YAML files.

- pyyaml: Can be an alternative to ruamel.yaml, but here it could be for redundancy or other script compatibility.

- boto3: For AWS operations like downloading files from S3.

Ansible Modules:

- ansible.builtin.pip: For installing Python packages.

- ansible.builtin.shell or ansible.builtin.command: To run shell commands.

- ansible.builtin.copy: To copy files between local and remote locations.

- community.aws.s3: For operations related to S3.
